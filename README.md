## Overview
Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool developed by Microsoft. It's designed to provide interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an intuitive user interface.

4. **Average Satisfaction Rating**: Visualization of the average satisfaction rating provided by customers.
5. **Monthly Trends**: Trend analysis of answered and unanswered calls on a monthly basis.
6. **Agent Statistics**: Detailed statistics showcasing individual agent performance metrics.

2. **Opening the Dashboard**: Open the Power BI file using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
